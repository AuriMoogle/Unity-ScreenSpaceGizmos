# Unity-ScreenSpaceGizmos
A small utility that let you draw gizmos in 'screen space'.

Unityâ€™s default gizmos are essential for visual debugging but can only be drawn in world space. This restriction can be rather annoying if you try to debug custom UI or viewport-based camera movement. 

This script solves the problem by drawing gizmos at the camera.NearClipPlane. It works with all camera projection types (perspective, orthographic) and canvas modes except world-space. In world-space just use the default Unity gizmos.
